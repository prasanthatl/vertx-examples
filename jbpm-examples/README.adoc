= Vert.x Jbpm examples

This project will demonstrate the usage of jbpm to create business processes(using jbpm) inside vertx. This example makes use of vertx event bus. A sender verticle will send a message, which will be received by a jbpm verticle. This verticle will start a jbpm process and pass  this message as a parameter to the process. Process will print this message in one of it's steps(script task).

The link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/jbpm/JbpmVerticle.java[JbpmVerticle.java] shows the Verticle with embedded Jbpm.

Process Definition can be found in  :src/main/resources/io/vertx/example/jbpm/sample.bpmn[sample.bpmn]

The link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/jbpm/JbpmVerticleTest.java[JbpmVerticleTest.java] shows the
junit test for running the verticle.

Additional Info

jbpm-examples project will be packaged as a kjar to include jbpm artifacts(bpmn and kie-module).

To run verticles

Create a uber jar with all dependencies. pom has a maven-shade-plugin for this.
run in command line -  mvn package.

Once the jar is created, run the vertx commands for deploying verticles.

vertx run io.vertx.example.jbpm.MsgSenderVerticle -cp <uber-jar-name.jar> -cluster

vertx run io.vertx.example.jbpm.JbpmVerticle -cp <uber-jar-name.jar> -cluster
